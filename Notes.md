common algorithms, clearly re-written
  * readable - easy to study, modify
  * working - not just theory
  * free - BSD license or public domain

notes
  * algorithms may be patented
  * these implementations may be slow. speed is not a requirement.
  * they could also be insecure. be careful before embedding in your product.

If you know a public algorithm or a format that might fit in this project, let me know.
